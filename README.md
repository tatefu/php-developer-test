## Assessment notes
Thank you for taking the time to complete this assessment and trust you will find everything that you need.

### Frontend component:
We require you to take the supplied PSD's and build a responsive page, making sure that the all markup is compatible with the browsers specified above.  
The font used for this test is Roboto, a free Google web font: [https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto)
You need to show competency in coding custom styled form elements.   
A star rating component has been added inside the form, which is not compulsory to complete, but rather there as a bonus (double bonus points if you don't use images).  
Use your discretion when setting up your breakpoints for the various layouts supplied.  

### PHP Component:
The form you create needs to be functional with the following criteria you need to adhere to: 

* The form validates using a PHP script; ideally making use of a validation library
* Verified forms should be posted to a MySQL table
* On successful submission, all form data that was saved should be sent back to front-end via a PHP AJAX routine
* The data must be displayed as laid out in the “Sign up success” block.
* The Sign up success block must ONLY be visible upon successful submission
* PHP code must conform to [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) standards.
* Any open-source libraries should be included using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
* All authentication credentials should be stored in a separate include file.

### Validation rules:
* All form elements are required
* Email address should have a valid email address
* DOB needs to be calculated and you cannot submit the form if I input an age of under 18.
* An example of what an error styling should look like has been provided and should be used for all error messages.

### Submitting your assessment:
* Once you are complete with your assessment, you are required to add it to an online repository where we can access your code to assess it.
* Please use a public repository on Github or Bitbucket
* Send the link to your repository to the email address listed below

Good luck, and if you have any questions please feel free to contact us.
